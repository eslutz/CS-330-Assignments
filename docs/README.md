# CS-330-Assignments

These files contain the tutorials and assignments for SNHU's CS-330 course on computational graphics and visualization using C++ and OpenGL.

## [Module 2 Assignment](../module02assignment)

The goal of this assignment is to write commented modern OpenGL code that creates two right-angle triangles.

## [Module 3 Assignment](../module03assignment)

The goal of this assignment is to write commented modern OpenGL code to create a 3D pyramid.

## [Module 4 Assignment](../module04assignment)

The goal of this assignment is to write commented modern OpenGL code that allows for panning, zooming, and orbiting a pyramid. Use the keyboard, mouse, and movement combinations below:

- WASD keys: These keys should be used to control the forward, backward, left, and right motion.
- QE keys: These keys should be used to control the upward and downward movement.
- Mouse cursor: This should be used to change the orientation of the camera so it can look up and down or left and right. Mouse scroll: This should be used to adjust the speed of the movement, or the speed the camera travels around the scene.

## [Module 5 Assignment](../module05assignment)

The goal of this assignment is to write commented modern OpenGL code to apply texture to a 3D pyramid.

- WASD keys: These keys should be used to control the forward, backward, left, and right motion.
- QE keys: These keys should be used to control the upward and downward movement.
- Mouse cursor: This should be used to change the orientation of the camera so it can look up and down or left and right. Mouse scroll: This should be used to adjust the speed of the movement, or the speed the camera travels around the scene.
